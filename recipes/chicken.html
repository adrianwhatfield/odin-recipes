        <p>One of the easiest Italian chicken recipes: Boneless breasts marinated in Italian-style salad dressing, then baked. It's the simplest and most delicious meal ever, and my husband thinks I cook all day to make it!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour salad dressing into a large resealable plastic bag. Add chicken breasts, seal bag, and shake to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight (the longer you marinate, the more flavor the chicken will absorb). </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish; discard remaining marinade. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning chicken occasionally, until cooked through and juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        </ol>
